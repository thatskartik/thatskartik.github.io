<h2>How to Solve it - George Polya</h2>
<p>This is meant to be an executive summary of the book titled “How to solve it”, written by George Polya<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sidenote-1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sidenote-1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote"><img alt="Polya" src="posts/HTSI/images/polya.jpg"/> <br/> George Polya <em>(1887 - 1985)</em></span> a Mathematician and Professor at Stanford University. In this summary, I will try to go through the main “questions” or problem solving techniques Polya mentions during the course of the book.</p>
<p>Here is the first problem where he encourages us to ask these important questions</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the data?</li>
<li>What is the unknown?</li>
<li>Have you seen a problem with a similar uknown?</li>
<li>Does the problem have a condition? Is the condition satsifiable?</li>
</ul>
<section class="level3" id="auxiliary-problems">
<h3>Auxiliary Problems</h3>
<p>A problem with a similar unknown is called an <em>auxiliary problem</em> in the book. Polya discusses techniques to come up with such a problem in the first place. He also states that certain classes of problems can hav auxiliary chains that run up to 5 to 6 steps long.</p>
<p>Technique to notice an auxiliary problem<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sidenote-2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sidenote-2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Consider solving the equation <span class="math display">\[16x^4 + 4x^2 + 1 = 0\]</span> Can you guess the auxiliary equation in this problem?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Have you seen a problem with a similar unknown</li>
<li>Can you make the problem more general<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sidenote-3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sidenote-3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Sometimes the general form is more accessible, because of the choice of notations used</span></li>
<li>Consider a variation of the problem that does not have certain conditions</li>
<li>Can you restate the problem?</li>
<li>Can you find an <em>analagous</em> problem?<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sidenote-4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sidenote-4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Find the centre of Gravity of a Homogeneous Tetrahedron, given that it is the centroid for a Homogeneous Triangle</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The techniques to derive different types of problems are either analogy (<em>isomorphisms</em>), or specializations(<em>unilateral reductions</em>) or decomposing and recombining the states of the problem</p>
<p>When you make a step in your reasoning, you have to ask certain questions again, and look for points of contact with former knowledge again.</p>

<h3>Decomposing and Recombining</h3>
<div class="epigraph">
<blockquote>
<p>Between the data and the unknown lies a bridge called the “Problem”, we can start building from either side of the bridge </p>
<footer>George Polya’</footer></blockquote>
</div>
<p>Starting from the data, you can try the following tools, firstly try to note the <em>obvious</em> things that you can derive from the data that is available in the problem. Ask yourself, <em>did you use all the data ?</em>. Focus on each aspect of the object of interest spearately, and then recombine all the information that you have.</p>
