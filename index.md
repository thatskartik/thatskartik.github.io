### About Me

Hi, I am Kartik. I am a senior at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT-Hyderabad](https://cse.iith.ac.in/).
I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr.Vineeth N Balasubramanian](https://people.iith.ac.in/vineethnb/index.html), [Dr. J Saketha Nath](https://people.iith.ac.in/saketha/) and [Dr. Muthukamalli Vidyasagar](https://people.iith.ac.in/m_vidyasagar/index.html).

## Research

Broadly, I take an interest in theoretical Machine Learning. Specifically, I take an interest in using techniques from Learning theory and statsitics to prove guarantees on the robustness/privacy of ML models. I am presenty working on [certain classes of problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_approximation) in Optimization.
