### About Me

Hi, I am Kartik, I am a senior at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT-Hyderabad](https://cse.iith.ac.in/). I like studying applied mathematics and am always on the lookout for elegant solutions to hard problems, or strong generalizations of simple problems[^mor] [^ex].

[^mor]: See the [Moreau Decomposition](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/693687/proof-of-the-moreau-decomposition-property-of-proximal-operators)

[^ex]: Against common perception, I have a life outside of mathematics. I play basektball, swim and love to hike and cook.
