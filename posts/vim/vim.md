### Using vim efficiently 


Here are a list of basic vim commands you should know

`:set number` in the normal mode will set the number lines 


If you hae installed the [NERDTree](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/nerdtree-red) plugin (scorolose) then it is easy to browse files in VIM

To use the NERDTree use the command

`:NERDTree`

and then browse the file like you would through any normal file.
The name is quite long so instead of that one can use a much shorter
version to write

Key notations and mappings are detailed in The following excellent [vim manual page](https://vimhelp.org/usr_40.txt.html#40.1)
