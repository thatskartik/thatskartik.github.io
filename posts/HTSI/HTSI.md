## How to Solve it - George Polya



This is meant to be an executive summary of the book titled "How to solve it", written by George Polya[^polya]  a
Mathematician and Professor at Stanford University. In this summary, I will try to go through the main "questions" or problem solving techniques Polya mentions during the
course of the book.

[^polya]: ![Polya][polya] <br> George Polya _(1887 - 1985)_

Here is the first problem where he encourages us to ask these important questions

- What is the data?
- What is the unknown?
- Have you seen a problem with a similar uknown?
- Does the problem have a condition? Is the condition satsifiable?

### Auxiliary Problems

A problem with a similar unknown is called an _auxiliary problem_ in the book.
Polya discusses techniques to come up with such a problem in the first place. He also states that certain classes of
problems can hav auxiliary chains that run up to 5 to 6 steps long.

Technique to notice an auxiliary problem[^aux1]

- Have you seen a problem with a similar unknown
- Can you make the problem more general[^acc]
- Consider a variation of the problem that does not have certain conditions
- Can you restate the problem?
- Can you find an _analagous_ problem?[^anal]


[^anal]: Find the centre of Gravity of a Homogeneous Tetrahedron, given that it is the centroid  for a Homogeneous Triangle



[^acc]: Sometimes the general form is more accessible, because of the choice of notations used


[^aux1]: Consider solving the equation $$16x^4 + 4x^2 + 1 = 0$$ Can you guess the auxiliary equation in this problem?


The techniques to derive different types of problems are either analogy (_isomorphisms_), or specializations(_unilateral
reductions_) or decomposing and recombining the states of the problem

When you make a step in your reasoning, you have to ask certain questions again, and look for points of contact with
former knowledge again.


### Decomposing and Recombining

bridge

Starting from the data, you can try the following tools, firstly try to note the _obvious_ things that you can derive
from the data that is available in the problem. Ask yourself, _did you use all the data ?_. Focus on each aspect of the
object of interest spearately, and then recombine all the information that you have.
