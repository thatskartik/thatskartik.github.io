<b> <u>A broad "research" goal</b></u>
<br>

Let us imagine what we want a "super-intelligence" $S$ to do in the future.

We want the following things

- $S$, which happens to learn from your private data, should also be able to forget it on demand
- $S$ should  be super, i.e. it should be able to do things you can't. For example generating amazing art, making
  accurate predictions about the future, all while utilizing reasonable amounts of energy and memorizing a reasonable
  amount of information.
- $S$ should be fair & unbiased, and should understand the moral principles that humans wish to uphold.
